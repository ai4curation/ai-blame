# A Winter's Dream

Snowflakes drift through the silent night,
Dancing in the silver moonlight,
Each one a whisper from the sky,
A fleeting moment passing by.

The frost adorns the sleeping trees,
Their branches bow before the breeze,
While stars look down with watchful gaze,
Upon the world's mysterious maze.

In winter's hush, the world finds peace,
All worries fade, all troubles cease,
The cold air carries ancient songs,
Of where our wandering heart belongs.

So let the snow fall soft and deep,
As all the world falls fast asleep,
For in this frozen, quiet land,
We find the dreams we understand.
