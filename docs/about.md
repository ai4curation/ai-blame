# About ai-blame

## Project

`ai-blame` is a tool for extracting and tracking provenance from AI agent execution traces. It emerged from work on AI-assisted curation of knowledge bases, ontologies, and structured data, but applies broadly to any code or content generated with AI assistance.

## Origin

This project is part of the broader **AI4Curation** ecosystem—a collection of patterns, tools, and workflows for maintaining knowledge bases and code in an age of AI pair programming.

## Key Use Cases

- **Knowledge base curation** — Track which AI models generated or edited ontology files
- **Code auditing** — Understand which parts of your codebase are AI-generated
- **Compliance** — Create audit trails for industries with strict provenance requirements
- **Model evaluation** — Compare output quality across different model versions
